📘 Two Sum — C Implementation (LeetCode)

📌 Overview

This repository contains a clean and efficient C implementation of the classic Two Sum problem from LeetCode.
The solution demonstrates fundamental Data Structures & Algorithms concepts, including array traversal, nested iteration, pointer usage, and dynamic memory allocation.

This project is intended for learning, interview preparation, and competitive programming practice.

🧠 Problem Statement

Given an integer array nums and an integer target, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target.

Constraints

Each input will have exactly one solution.

The same element cannot be used twice.

Indices can be returned in any order.

🛠 Solution Strategy

The approach uses a brute-force nested loop method:

Iterate over all pairs of elements.

Check whether their sum equals the target.

| Metric               | Complexity                      |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Time Complexity**  | `O(n²)`                         |
| **Space Complexity** | `O(1)` (excluding output array) |
